# Project Description

This is a website project for AnB School from team **AnB_Prime**.  
We clone from this website [car-rental-ten.vercel.app](https://car-rental-ten.vercel.app/).

This is our final result: [https://solid-adventure-l5vz3v6.pages.github.io/](https://solid-adventure-l5vz3v6.pages.github.io/).

The website aims to create a user-friendly and efficient online platform for customers to browse, select, and rent vehicles. This project encompasses the front-end development required to provide a seamless car rental experience for users.

# Git flow methods

Throughout the development, we followed **Git Flow** methodology.  
The final merged branch for our project is `main` branch.

## Branches:

Our production-ready branch is the `main` branch.  
We used 3 main branches for our project:

- `main` branch: it represents the latest production-ready state of our project. It contains stable code that is suitable for deployment.
- `develop` branch: it is where ongoing development and integration of new features occur. It's a branch from which feature branches are created and merged back once the features are complete.
- `feature` branch: for each new feature, a dedicated feature branch was created from the `develop` branch. Feature branches are where the actual coding takes place. To create a feature branch. Here is how we created the branch:

## How we worked:

- First of all, a bare bone project is created in **Github** with `main` and `develop` branches.
- We created issues related to the features that need to be built.
- Each member will be assigned each issues.
- Then each member will clone the project into their local computer.
- Each member initialize the `git flow` methodology and create a new feature branch.
- After finishing the features, each member will publish their branches and create pull request.
- Project leader will check the pull request and the code and merge it into `develop` branch.
