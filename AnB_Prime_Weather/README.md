# What I've learnt and improved

- Make UI more convenient. In the previous Todo List Project, my edit function was a bit complicated. Now, in this weather app, I have designed a clear function on search location function to make user experience better.
- I also improved animation in this weather app to make it more pleasing to the eyes.
- I also learnt to use a technique called `debounce` to reduce the number of API calls when searching locations thus improving the overall performance and user experience.

# Contributors

- Weather icons (Meteocons) to be shown based on weather conditions inspired by Mr. Yon Sokheng.
- `Preload` technique in index.html so that it downloads important asset first (ex: error image and icons). Inspired by Mr. Khim Phirom of Fireflies team.
- Other than that, I did by myself.
